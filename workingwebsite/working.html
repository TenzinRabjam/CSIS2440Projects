<p class="kp"><b>My name is Karanpreet Singh, I'm from Princeton, New Jersy. I have lived in Utah for a little over one year now. I like to play volleyball, hike, and do pretty much anything outdoors. I played volleyball from ages 12 to 18 and love to watch college and club games in my free time. I'm a computer science major here at SLCC and plan to transfer to the University of Utah next year. My Favorite Book is The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien, and my favorite films are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I am currently studying my prerequisite courses and some of my major related subjects, and will be getting ready to apply for the Computer Science program at University of Utah in the 2018.While attending Salt Lake Community College full time and working part time I don't have a great amount of time outside of school and work.When I am not working, attending my classes, or studying, there is nothing else I would rather do than spend time with my family. Whether it be going on a mini vacation, visiting our friends, or just sitting in doors watching movies and playing board games all night, we all enjoy each others company and have a great time.I love being involved in the outdoors and having hobbies because there is always so much you can learn about yourself in these elements.Whenever I get the opportunity to volunteer, I always make sure that I can set time away to do something good for the community.
